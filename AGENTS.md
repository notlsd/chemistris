# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The repository currently ships the playable Windows build in the root directory. `chemistris.exe` and `data.win` are the GameMaker runtime artifacts, while the hashed CSV files (`LEVEL...csv`, `PRODUCT...csv`, `REACTANT...csv`) hold level layouts and chemistry metadata. Keep fonts and other shared assets (e.g., `IBMPlexSansCondensed.ttf`) beside the executable so the runtime can resolve them without additional configuration. When introducing source assets or editor files, mirror the GameMaker convention: stage them under a `/source` folder, preserving resource group folders (sprites, objects, scripts) to keep export and binary outputs clearly separated.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Authoring work happens inside GameMaker Studio 2. Open the project file (`chemistris.yyp`) from the IDE, rebuild, then export a Windows package and replace `chemistris.exe` + `data.win` in this repository. For quick local sanity checks on macOS/Linux, use `wine chemistris.exe` from the repo root; on Windows, double-clicking the executable is sufficient. Always re-run the build after changing any CSV data so the export bundles the updated resources.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow GameMaker Language conventions: four-space indentation, `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` (or `Obj`/`Scr` prefixes) for resources, and `scrFunctionName` for reusable scripts. Keep CSV headers lowercase with underscores for multi-word fields. Before exporting, run GameMaker’s “Code Cleanup” to normalize whitespace and remove dead assets, and keep font or binary dependencies named consistently with their in-game identifiers.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no automated test harness; rely on scenario-based playtests. Validate each level CSV import by running the build and stepping through new combinations in Practice mode. When introducing gameplay changes, capture a video or GIF of the interaction and note any console output generated by the GameMaker debug overlay. Document regressions or edge cases in the PR description so other contributors can reproduce them.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Use concise, imperative commit messages in the style `fix: resolve reactor crash` or `feat: add cobalt level set`. Group unrelated changes into separate commits to simplify binary diffs. Each pull request should include a summary of gameplay or data changes, links to discussion issues, updated screenshots if the UI shifts, and confirmation that the packaged build in the root folder matches the committed source data. Request at least one reviewer before merging.
